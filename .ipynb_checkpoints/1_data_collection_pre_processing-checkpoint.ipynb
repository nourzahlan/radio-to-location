    "Had we been able to acquire an API token for streaming live audio from [Broadcastify](https://www.broadcastify.com/) (ostensibly they are concerned with mobile app developers abusing their service) our first step documented here would be API calls retrieving either archival or streaming radio feeds. Prevented from doing so, we elected to manually download the archives from all the feeds proximate in time and space to a recent natural disaster. Given that Broadcastify's archives only go back 180 days, we chose the recent catastrophic Camp Fire of last fall. From the seven feeds in Butte County, California we downloaded the nearly complete 24 hours of radio from the period of November 8 to November 23 of 2018 (the official period of the Camp Fire). In sum this provided us with 3,085 half-hour long MP3 files (13.8 GB)."

    "Scanner radio is always \"on\", even when there is no transmission. This means that each half-hour MP3 we collected was mostly radio silence. Also, each transmission is punctuated with the expected radio buzz and click noises. As-is the MP3 files were far from optimal samples for our model. They required cleaning and shaping. We used a library, [Pydub](http://pydub.com/), to perform our basic audio signal processing. This we did with 2 requirements in mind:\n",

    "Google Cloud's transcription service does not receive MP3 files, and has several additional specifications for the audio it can transcribe (channel count, sample width, length, size, sample rate, etc.). We therefore had to convert our file to the WAV format, and ensure we were meeting these criteria. Also, for the sake of accuracy, we wanted to eliminate the noises that were not speech, and isolate in short phrases the actual content of the transmissions."

We experimented with several values for the two parameters `min_silence_len` and `silence_thresh` and found defining silence as 1 second long and anything lower than -30 decibels was best. If any segment (in the code `chunks`) was either less than 8.5 seconds or more than 60 seconds long we did not export it to our `/samples` directory. In this way we were able to eliminate most of the radio noises, the radio silence, and generate nearly 100,000 speech samples 1 to 60 seconds in length (20 GB). \n"
